Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Vedant Singhania and I am from Palo Alto, California. I have been coding since I was 12 and since then, I have become highly proficient in HTML, Python, Java, and JavaScript, and various frameworks and libraries, I have taken college-level computer science courses in high school, and I am now in the midst of my first year as a computer science major at San Jos√© State University. While I enjoy working on my own projects to help people in their everyday lives, I also have a passion for contributing to open source code in the community.


Besides majoring in and having a deep passion for computer science, I am strong in my academics, I love singing in choir and making music, and I often volunteer in the community.
