2. Go to http://localhost:4321

## Using this as a template

Want to create your own website from this template? Click `Use this template` to get started! This is an theme that has been verified by Astro (the framework used to built my website). You can find the posting [here](https://astro.build/themes/details/minimal-personal-website-portfolio/).

Once you've copied the code via the use template button and cloned your copy of the template locally, you can get started by running `npm install`. This will install the dependencies (you only need to do this once). Next, run `npm run dev` to start the dev server. 

Now, you can edit the json files in src/content/data to add your own information to the site. You may need to make a couple of edits to some of the other files for some of the content customization.

Please open an issue [here](https://github.com/raspberri05/website/issues) if you are having any trouble with using this repository as a template and I can try my best to help resolve the issue.

### Want new features in this template?

Please open an issue or pull request on the template repository (not your copy of the template) that explains the new feature in detail
