## About

This the code for my personal website.

1. `npm run dev`
2. Go to http://localhost:4321

## Using this as a template

Want to create your own website from this template? Click `Use this template` to get started! This is an theme that has been verified by Astro (the framework used to built my website) as a theme. You can find the posting [here](https://astro.build/themes/details/minimal-personal-website-portfolio/).

Once you've copied the code via the use template button and cloned your copy of the template locally, you can get started by running `npm install`. This will install the dependencies (you only need to do this once). Next, run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.

Now, you can edit the json files in src/content/data to customize the template with your own information. Make sure to update each file in src/content/data accordingly

Please open an issue [here](https://github.com/raspberri05/website/issues) if you are having any trouble with using this repository as a template and I can try my best to help resolve the issue.

## Want new features in this template?

Please open an issue that explains the feature request in detail or pull request adding the feature on the template repository (not your copy of the template)!
