      Hi, I&apos;m Naya Singhania! I&apos;ve been passionate about coding since
      I was 12, and that enthusiasm has driven me to explore various
      technologies and frameworks since then. I'm currently a Computer Science
      student at SJSU, where I&apos;ve honed my skills in Next.js and React. I
      enjoy creating dynamic web applications that provide seamless user
      experiences, and I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In addition to my development work, I have a deep interest in AI and using
      it in development. For instance, I am developing a full-stack application
      that analyzes user music listening history to create a listener "persona".
      I also developed ChairSense, a project that utilizes various sensors and a
      microcontroller to implement obstacle detection on wheelchairs, showcasing
      my commitment to leveraging technology for accessibility. Beyond tech, I
      am passionate about choir and producing music, where I express my
      creativity and connect with others through music.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As I continue my journey in tech, I&apos;m actively seeking internship
      opportunities that will allow me to further develop my skills and gain
      hands-on experience. If you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic
      developer with a strong foundation in Next.js and a passion for
      innovation, let&apos;s connect! I&apos;m excited to collaborate and
      explore new possibilities in the tech world.
