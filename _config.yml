  about:
    p1: "My name is Vedant Singhania, from Palo Alto, California. I have been coding since I was 12, starting with MIT Scratch. Since then I have become proficient at 4 programming languages by self-teaching and taking computer science classes in school, which I have used to create applications to help people in their everyday lives. More recently, I have delved into the world of Arduino and C/C++ in order to create low-cost products to assist wheelchair users like me to be able to navigate the world more independently."
    p2: "Besides computer science, I am strong in academics and take Advanced Placement classes to challenge me, I love singing in choir, and I often volunteer at organizations locally and nationally."

    description: "For wheelchair users, it can be hard to see what's behind the chair, especially when backing up or turning, which can be dangerous because there is a high potential to hit an object or person. The aim of this project is to solve that problem by creating a low-cost device that can detect obstacles and warn the wheelchair user so they don't hit objects or people."
