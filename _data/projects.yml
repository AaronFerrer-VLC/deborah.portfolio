  description: For wheelchair users, it can be hard to see what's behind the chair, especially when backing up or turning, which can be dangerous because there is a high potential to hit an object or person. The aim of this project is to solve that problem by creating a low-cost device that can detect obstacles and warn the wheelchair user so they don't hit objects or people.
